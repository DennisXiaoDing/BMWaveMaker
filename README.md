# BMWaveMaker
- Make the Wave
- Version: 1.1

# DEMO
  <center> ![image](https://github.com/DennisXiaoDing/BMWaveMaker/blob/master/ScreenShot/ScreenShot.gif) </center>

# How To Use
1. **Alloc the instance**

		_maker = [[BMWaveMaker alloc] init];


2. **Assign the detination view**

    This step is necessary, other wise, the maker will not have the animation and also throw out the warning message;

  		  _maker.animationView = self.view;


3. **Use the Methods**
https://momolens.co/

   ##### Span Wave

          - (void)spanWave; //span a single wave

		  /**
 		   *  span numerous waves
 		   *
		   *  @param timeInteral waves cycle
 		   */
		  - (void)spanWaveContinuallyWithTimeInterval:(NSTimeInterval)timeInterval;


   ##### Stop Wave

		  /**
 		   *  stop wave animation
		   *
		   *  @param immediately - if the value is YES, the waves will be removed immediately, otherwise, they'll be removed automatically
		   */
		  - (void)stopWaveImmediately:(BOOL)immediately;

		  /**
		   *  stop wave animation;  
		   *  same as  [waveMaker stopWaveImmediately:NO];
		   */
		  - (void)stopWave;

4. **Parameters Explaintions**

         /**
		  *  the view which will add the animations;
		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, weak) UIView *animationView;

	     /**
		  *  the center of the wave, default is the View's center;
 		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, assign) CGPoint waveCenter;

		 /**
		  *  wave's width, default is 2.0f;
		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat wavePathWidth;

		 /**
		  *  span animation duration, default is 1.0f;
		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat animationDuration;

		 /**
		  *  wave's color - Arc's color, default is [UIColor blueColor];
 		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *waveColor;

		 /**
		  *  the origin wave layer's radius, not contains the board width;
		  *  default value is 20.0f;
		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat originRadius;

		 /**
		  *  The following two property is used for calculating the final wave's size.
		  *  The properties are alternative, if they are setted the value at the same time,
		  *  the property spanSale is valid and the finalRadius property will be ignored.
 		  */

		 ///Zoom in scale, the value should be greater than 1.0f;
		 @property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat spanScale;
		 ///Zoom in final radius, the value should be greater than originRadius, if not, the value will be originRadius * 2;
		 @property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat finalRadius;

		 /**
		  *  the color filled in the wave;
		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, assign) UIColor *waveFillColor;

		 /**
		  *  the stauts suggested that if the view has waves waving;
 		  */
		 @property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL isWaving;
